      <description>Transforms the orignal set of features into a into a different dimension of less features
Feature creation #  Creating feature which has more info that the original dataset.
Methodologies #    Feature extraction
 Domain specific In multimedia, low-level (pitch, tonality), mid-level (fourier, wavelet), high-level(tag, genre)    Mapping data to new space
 Fourier trans (freq domain) Wavelet trans (freq + time domain) Scale-Invariant Feature trans (SIFT) (Capute important/minuate points)    Feature construction</description>

      <description>Feature Reduction #  Why? #  Too many features in a dataset complicates the model&amp;rsquo;s prediction strategy. Since most clustering models use some sort of distance measure, too many dimensions will result in many isolated clusters.
How many is too many? #  One indication is when there are too many features than the observations.
How? #   Principal Component Analysis Non-Negative Matrix Factorization Linear discriminant analysis t-SNE  References #  </description>

      <description>Feature Selection #  Data sets that data scientists work upon arrives from multitude of sources. Hence, transforming data from these multiple sources to a common format is a mandatory step for deriving meaningful inference. Data will also have errors/deviations at the source of origin as well. We have a to make a careful consideration on how to handle such data points since these affect the learning model developed.
The extreme observations, when it influences the model performance are called influential points.</description>

      <description>Why? #  Engineer the data suitable for building faster and simple models.
Steps,
 Clean Format  Data Quality issues #   Missing values - Values not present. e.x. User&amp;rsquo;s unwillingness, non mandatory, storage issues, not applicable info, n/w &amp;amp; storage errors Duplicate data - Redundant data objects. Customer added new address, customers sharing address Inconsistent/Invalid data - Impossible values e.x. negative age, income, invalid zip code; Data entry errors Noise - Meaningless or invalid data; e.</description>

      <description>Feature Engineering #  The source of data available for Model training is vast, crude and usually not formatted. Various methods are employed to streamline the data to effectively train the model.
Feature Selection #  In feature selection the input attributes are dropped or modified based on the model.
Dimensionality Reduction #  Dimensionality reduction creates new combination of attributes. e.g. Principal Component Analysis, Singular Value Decomposition and Sammonâ€™s Mapping.</description>
